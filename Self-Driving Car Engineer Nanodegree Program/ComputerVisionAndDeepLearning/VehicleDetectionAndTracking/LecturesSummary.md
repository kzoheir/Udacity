Suppose you have a scattered plot of (training) data. This chapter deals with how to predict a the output for a new input.
Example: In Stanley, we need to determine the car SPEED (high/low) based on the SLOP and the ROGHNESS of the terrain.

Three ways to cluster (separate) input data:
-- Naive Bayes (name is not indicative)
-- Support Vector Machines  (name is not indicative)
-- Decision trees
